# Frontend Design Skill — Comprehensive Summary

> **License:** Complete terms in LICENSE.txt

## Core Philosophy

> **Approach this as the design lead at a small studio known for giving every client a visual identity that could not be mistaken for anyone else's.** This client has already rejected proposals that felt templated, and is paying for a distinctive point of view: **make deliberate, opinionated choices about palette, typography, and layout that are specific to this brief, and take one real aesthetic risk you can justify.**

---

## 1. Ground It in the Subject

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Define** | If the brief doesn't pin down the product/subject, **pin it yourself**: name one concrete subject, its audience, and the page's single job |
| **Use context** | Leverage any memory of human preferences, project context, or prior designs as hints |
| **Source from the subject** | The subject's own world — its materials, instruments, artifacts, and vernacular — is where distinctive choices come from |
| **Build with real content** | Use the brief's actual content and subject matter throughout |

---

## 2. Design Principles

### Hero = Thesis

> **Open with the most characteristic thing in the subject's world**, in whatever form makes sense: a headline, an image, an animation, a live demo, an interactive moment.

- Be deliberate — **a big number + small label + supporting stats + gradient accent is the template answer**; only use if truly the best option

### Typography Carries Personality

- **Pair display and body faces deliberately** — not the same families you'd reach for on any other project
- Set a **clear type scale** with intentional weights, widths, and spacing
- Make the **type treatment itself a memorable part of the design**, not a neutral delivery vehicle

### Structure Is Information

> **Structural devices (numbering, eyebrows, dividers, labels) should encode something true about the content, not decorate it.**

- Numbered markers (01/02/03) only appropriate if content **actually is a sequence** (real process, typed timeline where order carries needed information)
- **Question** if choices like numbered markers actually make sense before incorporating

### Leverage Motion Deliberately

| Motion Type | When to Use |
|-------------|-------------|
| Page-load sequence | Sets tone, orients user |
| Scroll-triggered reveal | Progressive disclosure |
| Hover micro-interactions | Feedback, affordance |
| Ambient atmosphere | Brand immersion |

- **An orchestrated moment usually lands harder than scattered effects** — choose what the direction calls for
- **Sometimes less is more** — extra animation can contribute to feeling AI-generated

### Match Complexity to Vision

- **Maximalist** → elaborate execution
- **Minimal** → precision in spacing, type, and detail
- **Elegance = executing the chosen vision well**

### Consider Written Content Carefully

> **Copy can make a design feel as templated as the design itself.** See [Writing in Design](#7-more-on-writing-in-design) for guidance.

## 3. Process: Brainstorm → Explore → Plan → Critique → Build → Critique Again

### The Three AI Default Clusters (Avoid Unless Brief Demands)

1. **Warm cream** (~#F4F1EA) + high-contrast serif display + terracotta accent
2. **Near-black** + single bright acid-green or vermilion accent
3. **Broadsheet-style** + hairline rules + zero border-radius + dense newspaper columns

> **All three are legitimate for some briefs, but they are defaults rather than choices, and they appear regardless of subject.** Where the brief pins down a visual direction, follow it exactly. Where it leaves an axis free, **don't spend that freedom on one of these defaults.**

### Two-Pass Workflow

#### Pass 1: Design Plan (Compact Token System)

| Token | Specification |
|-------|---------------|
| **Color** | 4–6 named hex values |
| **Type** | 2+ roles: characterful display face (used with restraint), complementary body face, utility face for captions/data if needed |
| **Layout** | One-sentence prose descriptions + ASCII wireframes to ideate/compare |
| **Signature** | **The single unique element this page will be remembered by** that embodies the brief appropriately |

#### Pass 2: Review & Revise

> **If any part reads like the generic default you would produce for any similar page — revise that part, say what you changed and why.**

- Work through a similar prompt to see if you arrive somewhere similar
- Only after confirming relative uniqueness → start writing code
- Follow revised plan exactly; derive every color/type decision from it

### CSS Specificity Warning

> **Be careful of structuring CSS selector specificities.** It's easy to generate classes that cancel each other out (especially with type-based like `.section` and element-based like `.cta`). This often happens with paddings/margins between sections.

---

## 4. Color

### Palette Discipline

- **4–6 named colors max** — background, surface, foreground, muted, primary, accent(s)
- Name them semantically: `--bg`, `--fg`, `--muted`, `--primary`, `--accent`, `--card`
- **No raw hex in components** — only var() references
- One **signature accent** used with restraint; it should feel intentional, not decorative

### Avoid Default Palettes

Don't reach for:
- Tailwind's slate/stone/zinc/slate/etc. as-is
- Generic "semantic" color mappings without subject grounding
- "Safe" combinations that appear across unrelated projects

### Dark Mode by Default

Design for dark first; derive light as inversion with intention. Test both.

---

## 5. Typography

### Font Selection

- **Display face**: Chosen for character; used sparingly (headlines, hero, key moments)
- **Body face**: Readable at length; complementary — not same family as display unless deliberate
- **Utility face** (optional): Monospace or condensed for data, code, captions
- **Total: 2–3 families max** — every additional family needs justification

### Type Scale

- Define a **modular scale** (e.g., 1.25 ratio) with named steps: `--text-xs`, `--text-sm`, `--text-base`, `--text-lg`, `--text-xl`, `--text-2xl`, `--text-3xl`, `--text-4xl`
- **Weights**: Use the full range (100–900) intentionally — don't default to 400/600/700
- **Letter-spacing**: Tighten at display sizes; normal at body sizes
- **Line-height**: Tighter for headlines (1.1–1.2); relaxed for body (1.5–1.7)

### Variable Fonts

Prefer variable fonts when available — single file, continuous weight/width/optical-size control.

---

## 6. Layout & Composition

### Spacing System

- **Base unit**: 4px or 8px — all spacing derives from it
- Named tokens: `--space-1` … `--space-12` (or similar)
- **No magic numbers** in component styles

### Grid & Container

- **Max-width container** for content; full-bleed for hero/atmosphere
- **Asymmetric layouts** welcome when they serve the content
- **Whitespace as active element** — not empty space, but breathing room that directs attention

### Responsive Behavior

- Define breakpoints as named tokens: `--bp-sm`, `--bp-md`, `--bp-lg`, `--bp-xl`
- **Mobile-first** by default; enhance up
- Content reflow should feel intentional, not like "stacking"

## 7. More on Writing in Design

### Copy Is Part of the Design

- **Headlines**: Specific, not clever. The hero headline should be the thesis statement
- **Body**: Conversational density — not marketing fluff, not technical manual
- **Microcopy**: Button labels, form hints, empty states — all carry voice
- **Consistent voice** across every string in the interface

### Avoid AI Writing Tells

- "Elevate your X" / "Unlock the power of Y" / "Seamless experience"
- Lists of 3 benefit bullets with parallel structure
- "In today's world..." / "In the fast-paced landscape..."
- **If it could be on any SaaS landing page, rewrite it.**

---

## 8. Motion & Interaction

### Principles

- **Motion serves content** — never motion for motion's sake
- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`** — always provide no-motion fallback
- **Duration**: 150–300ms for UI feedback; 500–1000ms for choreographed sequences
- **Easing**: Custom cubic-bezier, not `ease` / `ease-in-out` defaults

### Choreography

- **Staggered entrance** for lists/grids (50–100ms delay per item)
- **Shared element transitions** for navigation
- **One hero animation** per page — the "signature motion"

---

## 9. Verification Checklist

Before declaring done, **screenshot and verify**:

- [ ] Design has a **distinctive point of view** — not a default cluster
- [ ] Color palette is **4–6 semantic tokens**, derived from subject
- [ ] Typography uses **2–3 deliberate font choices** with a defined scale
- [ ] Layout has **intentional asymmetry or structure** — not generic grid
- [ ] Copy is **specific to this subject** — no AI tells
- [ ] Motion is **purposeful and restrained** — respects reduced-motion
- [ ] Dark and light modes both **look designed** (not inverted defaults)
- [ ] **Signature element** exists — the one thing you'd remember

---

## 10. Anti-Patterns (What to Actively Avoid)

| Pattern | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Generic "hero + 3 columns + footer" | Could be any SaaS |
| Tailwind defaults without customization | Reads as "unconfigured" |
| Gradient text on dark bg | Default AI decorator |
| 3-column benefit grids | Template tell |
| "Elevate/Unlock/Transform" copy | Marketing sludge |
| Animation on everything | Feels synthetic |
| Same Inter/Roboto + slate palette | Zero personality |

---

## 11. When Brief Provides Constraints

- **Design system exists** → Extend it, don't replace. Document what you're adding.
- **Brand guidelines exist** → Follow exactly. Your job is execution within constraints.
- **Component library exists** → Compose from it. Don't rebuild primitives.
- **Accessibility requirements** → Non-negotiable. WCAG AA minimum.

---

## 12. Handoff to Implementation

If you're designing for another agent to build:

1. **Produce the design plan** (tokens, wireframes, signature element)
2. **Annotate** component hierarchy and states
3. **Specify** exact CSS custom properties
4. **Flag** any non-standard browser APIs needed
5. **Verify** the built result against screenshots
